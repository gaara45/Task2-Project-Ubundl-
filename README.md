*Create a Product Carousel for Featured Products*

*here's an explaination*
For this project, I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a product carousel for an anime posters shop.


HTML: Provided the structure of the webpage, including the container for the carousel and individual product elements.


CSS: Styled the layout, colors, and responsive design of the carousel and its items. Media queries were used to adjust image sizes for different screen sizes.


JavaScript: Implemented functionality for manual navigation through the carousel using previous and next buttons, as well as an automatic rotation feature to showcase featured products.
